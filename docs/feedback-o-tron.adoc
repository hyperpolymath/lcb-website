= Feedback-o-Tron integration

`feedback-o-tron` becomes our multi-platform feedback conduit for the hardened WordPress site. Whenever the Crane (Yacht) or Wharf agents detect a manifest discrepancy, consent failure, or container anomaly, they hand the report to `feedback-o-tron` so it transparently issues the same issue across GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/Codeberg and verifies network delivery before logging it.

== Key touchpoints
* The Rust agent or Svalinn policy engine can call `feedback-o-tron` via its Claude MCP tool (`submit_feedback`) with the manifest ID, error summary, and relevant URLs so the audit trail is automatically distributed to every upstream repo.
* Deduplication ensures we do not flood maintainers with repeated consent or manifest 430 cases; `Deduplicator.check/1` runs before submission and `NetworkVerifier` ensures we received TLS/DNS+RPKI guarantees.
* Feedback-o-Tron’s audit log (JSON lines) becomes part of the Santa Trail: we attach it to the Cerro Torre bundle metadata so the provenance chain records which reports were sent and when.

== How to use
1. Clone `/mnt/eclipse/repos/feedback-o-tron` and follow its `Quick Start`: `mix deps.get` and `mix run --no-halt` from `elixir-mcp` to start the MCP tool server.  
2. When the hardened WP image rejects a request (consent or manifest), call the MCP `submit_feedback` tool. Include details like `platforms` (all four), `title` (e.g., “manifest attestation failure”), and the `repo` you want to notify.  
3. Keep the environment secrets (GH, GL, etc.) in a secure vault; the repo’s `config`/`env` guidelines show how to rotate credentials and obey the credential rotation policy.
4. Store the audit log output inside the proof bundle so future auditors can see that the issue was reported and verified before the incident chain reached Svalinn.

## Why this matters
Using `feedback-o-tron` ensures every bot/AI consent failure or manifest discrepancy triggers a synchronized, provable report across the federation. The hardened site thus stays transparent and accountable while still enforcing AI consent and container verification.

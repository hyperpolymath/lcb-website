= Robot Repo Automaton integration

We include `robot-repo-automaton` as the automation orchestrator ensuring our repository operations obey robotic policies, trigger flows, and stay machine-reviewable.

## Responsibilities
- Robot tests ensure any new manifest or consent flow has a reproducible guard; the automaton repo offers scripts for policy compliance, deployment gating, and AI review so integrate their hooks into `just validate`/`just ci` recipes.
- The automaton can provision containers and proofs; align its workflows with our ZeroTier, Svalinn, and Twingate components by reusing its state files when packaging the hardened WordPress artifact.
- Use the automaton’s shared context to propagate new docs (consent, feedback, well-known) so the fleet bots automatically consume them without manual registration.

## Next steps
1. Link to `robot-repo-automaton/README.adoc` and relevant `scripts` so every automation recipe references the canonical policy.  
2. Ensure triggers run after we build the hardened theme/masks in Containerfile and before we push to feedback or dispatch notifications.  
3. Keep the integration doc updated with release-phase commands (just run automation recipes) and mention when we add new components triggered by the automaton.

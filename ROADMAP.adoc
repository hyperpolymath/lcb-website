== Current Status (2026-02-14)

Phase 1 (repo preparation) is **complete**. The repo contains all contractiles, templates, security configs, container build files, and 17 CI/CD workflows. Phase 2 (Verpex deployment) is next.

See `TOPOLOGY.md` for the architecture diagram and completion dashboard.

== Q1 2026 — Go Live on Verpex

* **Deploy WordPress 6.9** on Verpex cPanel with Sinople theme, php-aegis, and all plugins.
* **Configure Cloudflare** DNS (A records), SSL (Full Strict), WAF, Bot Fight Mode, HTTP/3.
* **Create all WordPress pages** from `content/pages/` and `content/policies/` markdown.
* **Security hardening**: Wordfence 2FA, security headers (A+ on securityheaders.com), encrypted backups.
* **Members area**: bbPress forum (4 forums), Members plugin with `nuj_member` role, privacy-first defaults.
* **LiteSpeed Cache**: TTLs matching Varnish VCL rules, Redis object cache if available, WebP image optimisation.
* **Email**: WP Mail SMTP via Verpex SMTP or transactional service.
* **.well-known** files served correctly with AIBDP consent enforcement.

== Q2 2026 — Stapeln Container Path

* Build and verify the Cerro Torre manifest (`infra/wordpress.ctp`) using Chainguard wolfi-base; capture SBOM/in-toto artifacts.
* Switch to signed containers: `cerro-torre sign` with Ed25519 (Dilithium5 when available).
* Deploy via `selur-compose.yml` with svalinn gateway + vordr runtime.
* Wire feedback-o-tron MCP integration for incident pipeline.
* Expand automation router + robot automaton triggers.

== Q3 2026 — Post-Quantum & Monitoring

* Migrate policy hashes from SHA-256 to SHAKE3-512 (FIPS 202).
* Implement Ed448 + Dilithium5 hybrid signatures for CTP manifests.
* Add Kyber-1024 (ML-KEM-1024) post-quantum key exchange.
* Harden monitoring: UptimeRobot, Wordfence alerting pipeline, LiteSpeed Cache dashboards.
* Security audit: panic-attack assail + echidna proofing.

== Handover Readiness

* Keep `.machine_readable/6scm/` metadata updated after every session.
* Update `TOPOLOGY.md` completion dashboard when components change.
* Ensure `contractiles/must/Mustfile` passes all checks before releases.
* Run `runhaskell contractiles/trust/Trustfile.hs` for crypto verification.
* Document how to run `just validate`, `ct pack`, and the consent/bot handoff requirements.

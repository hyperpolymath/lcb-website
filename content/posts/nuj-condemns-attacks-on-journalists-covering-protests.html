<p>The NUJ London Central Branch strongly condemns recent incidents in which journalists covering public demonstrations in London were obstructed, assaulted, or had their equipment damaged.</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>During recent protests in central London, multiple NUJ members reported being pushed, having their cameras knocked from their hands, or being told by police officers that they could not film or photograph in public spaces. In one incident, a journalist's press card was ignored by officers who insisted the media leave the area.</p>

<h2>The Law Is Clear</h2>
<p>Journalists have every right to report from public spaces. The NUJ reminds all members that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is <strong>no law preventing photography or filming in public places</strong> in England and Wales</li>
    <li>A valid NUJ press card should be respected by police as proof of media credentials</li>
    <li>Officers should facilitate, not obstruct, the work of journalists at public events</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Do If Obstructed</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Stay calm and identify yourself as a journalist</li>
    <li>Note the officer's shoulder number and any witnesses</li>
    <li>Report the incident to the NUJ immediately</li>
    <li>Contact the branch safety officer for support</li>
</ol>

<p>The NUJ has written to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner requesting a meeting to discuss these incidents and to reinforce the guidance on media access at public events.</p>

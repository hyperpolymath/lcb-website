<p>The NUJ Freelance Office has released the updated <strong>2026 Freelance Rate Guide</strong>, reflecting current market conditions and recommended minimum rates for journalism across all platforms.</p>

<h2>What's Changed</h2>
<p>The updated guide includes revised rates for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>National newspapers</strong>: Print news stories, features, opinion columns</li>
    <li><strong>Digital outlets</strong>: Online-only publications, news websites</li>
    <li><strong>Broadcasting</strong>: Radio packages, television reports, podcast contributions</li>
    <li><strong>Photography</strong>: Editorial, events, stock usage rights</li>
    <li><strong>Sub-editing and production</strong>: Shift rates and per-piece rates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Rates Matter</h2>
<p>Fair rates are essential for the sustainability of quality journalism. When publishers pay below the recommended minimum, they undermine the profession and make it harder for journalists to earn a living wage.</p>

<p>The NUJ encourages all freelance members to use the rate guide when negotiating fees and to report publishers who consistently offer below-minimum rates to the Freelance Office.</p>

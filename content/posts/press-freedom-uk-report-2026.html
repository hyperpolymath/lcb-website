<p>The NUJ has published its annual assessment of press freedom in the United Kingdom, highlighting ongoing concerns about journalist safety, source protection, and the chilling effect of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs).</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SLAPPs</strong>: Despite government promises, comprehensive anti-SLAPP legislation has not yet been enacted. Journalists and small publishers continue to face disproportionate legal threats from wealthy litigants.</li>
    <li><strong>Source protection</strong>: The Investigatory Powers Act continues to enable mass surveillance that undermines journalists' ability to protect confidential sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety</strong>: Threats and harassment of journalists, particularly women and journalists of colour covering politics and social issues, remain a serious concern.</li>
    <li><strong>AI and copyright</strong>: The use of journalistic content to train AI models without consent or compensation represents a growing threat to the economic sustainability of journalism.</li>
</ul>

<p>The London Central Branch calls on all members to support the NUJ's campaign for stronger legal protections for journalists and a free press. Contact your MP and share the report widely.</p>

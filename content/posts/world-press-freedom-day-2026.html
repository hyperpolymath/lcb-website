<p>The NUJ London Central Branch marks <strong>World Press Freedom Day</strong> on 3 May 2026 with a renewed call for the protection of journalists worldwide and the defence of editorial independence.</p>

<h2>This Year's Theme</h2>
<p>UNESCO's theme for World Press Freedom Day 2026 focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and press freedom. As AI tools become embedded in newsrooms, questions about editorial integrity, algorithmic bias, and the economic impact on journalists take on new urgency.</p>

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>The London Central Branch is organising a panel discussion on <strong>"AI in the Newsroom: Opportunity or Threat?"</strong> to be held on 3 May at 6:30pm. Speakers include working journalists, technology researchers, and NUJ officials.</p>

<p>The event is free and open to all NUJ members and supporters. Register via the branch events page or contact the branch secretary.</p>

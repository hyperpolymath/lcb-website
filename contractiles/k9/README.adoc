= K9 Contractiles — LCB Website
:toc:

K9 contractiles are self-validating configuration components using Nickel.

== Security Levels ("The Leash")

`'Kennel`:: Pure data — no side effects, no signature required.
`'Yard`:: Validated config — Nickel evaluation only, signature recommended.
`'Hunt`:: Full execution — Just recipes, signature *required*.

== LCB Website K9 Files

* `wordpress-config.k9.ncl` — Kennel-level WordPress configuration data (DB settings, cache TTLs, security constants).
* `deployment-config.k9.ncl` — Yard-level deployment validation (Verpex settings, Cloudflare DNS, SSL mode).

== Integration

K9 contractiles complement the main contractiles (must/trust/dust/lust) by
providing type-checked, self-validating configuration that can be consumed by
the justfile, Containerfile, or deployment scripts.

See `rsr-template-repo/contractiles/k9/` for the full K9 specification.

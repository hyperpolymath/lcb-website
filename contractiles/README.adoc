:toc:
:sectnums:

This directory contains the contractiles for the NUJ London Central Branch website deployment. These establish the operational, validation, trust, recovery, and intent framework for the hardened WordPress stack.

== Fill-In Instructions

1. `must/Mustfile` validates lcb-website invariants: Sinople theme, .well-known files, robots.txt, security headers, SPDX headers.
2. `trust/Trustfile.hs` embeds the full cryptographic specification and verifies policy hashes, schema signatures, PQ signatures, and migration provenance.
3. `dust/Dustfile` defines WordPress-specific rollback and recovery: database restores, theme rollback, plugin rollback, .htaccess recovery.
4. `lust/Intentfile` declares the stapeln integration roadmap: Cerro Torre verified builds, Selur orchestration, Vordr runtime.

== Contents
